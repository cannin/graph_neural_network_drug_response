## Comments

I went to a conference and so don't have any progress this week. But I met Augustin and some guys from UCSD's DrugCell's Lab. 
It was nice to meet them and talk about the model. I could make sure what I will do next week, visualize the weight for the graph structure and retrain model.
Next week, probably I can show some progress.

## Next Step

- train new model
- visualize weights
