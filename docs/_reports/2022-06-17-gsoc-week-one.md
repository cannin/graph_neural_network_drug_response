    Branch: **None**.       
    PR: **None**.  
   
    I'm still struggling to create the binder environment.  

2. [Reformat CellMinerCDB Data for DrugCell ](https://github.com/cannin/graph_neural_network_drug_response/issues/2).  
    Status: **In progress**.  
    Branch: **[6-drugcell-test](https://github.com/cannin/graph_neural_network_drug_response/tree/6-drugcell-test)**.       PR: **None**.  
    
    I can extract from rcellminer. 

3. [Run DrugCell Model on CellMinerCDB Data](https://github.com/cannin/graph_neural_network_drug_response/issues/6).  
    Status: **In progress**.   
    Branch: **[6-drugcell-test](https://github.com/cannin/graph_neural_network_drug_response/tree/6-drugcell-test)**.  
    PR: **None**.   
    
    I can run DrugCell with rcellminer data.
    
## Comments

Finally, I can run DrugCell with rcellminer data. But there are too many steps. So I wanna be more simple.
But anyway I can go further by today's result! üëè By the way, creating binder environment is still difficult. 
Today, I can install all of the libraries but somehow there are PATH problem for rpy2, so I'll try to deal with this sometime.

## Next Step

- Share today's progress with Augustin.
- Analyse results in detail.
