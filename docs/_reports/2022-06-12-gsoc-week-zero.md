## About Me
I am a PhD student at [University of Minnesota](https://twin-cities.umn.edu/), working with Dr. [Rui Kuang](https://www-users.cse.umn.edu/~kuang/). My research interests are machine learning, biological networks, drug discovery and graph theory.

## GSoC Project

- [GSoC Project URL](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/programs/2022/projects/ylOolPrk)
- [Work Repository](https://github.com/cannin/graph_neural_network_drug_response)

Mentor:
**Augustin Luna** ([@cannin](https://github.com/cannin))

## Tasks

1. [Setup GSOC Blog](https://github.com/cannin/graph_neural_network_drug_response/issues/1).  
    Status: **Complete**.     
    Branch: **None**.  
        PR: **None**.  

    Setting up it thanks to Augustin's help ðŸ™‡

2. [Reformat CellMinerCDB Data for DrugCell ](https://github.com/cannin/graph_neural_network_drug_response/issues/2).  
    Status: **In progress**.  
    Branch: **None**.  
        PR: **None**.  

    Explored data in the DrugCell [here](https://github.com/inoue0426/DrugCell/blob/public/notebook/Playground.ipynb).

3. [Document Project Dependencies](https://github.com/cannin/graph_neural_network_drug_response/issues/8).  
    Status: **In progress**.  
    Branch: **None**.  
        PR: **None**.  
    
    Created Python and R environment using pipenv.   

4. [Run DrugCell Model on CellMinerCDB Data](https://github.com/cannin/graph_neural_network_drug_response/issues/6).  
    Status: **In progress**.   
    Branch: **None**.   
        PR: **None**.   
    
    Try to do that [here](https://github.com/inoue0426/DrugCell/blob/public/notebook/DrugCell%20Sample.ipynb), but it did not work because I don't know how to get the pair of cell line and SMILES. Want to make sure about this in next meeting.
    
## Comments

- I explored sample data and got some knowledge about data structure.  
- It looks not so difficult to make data, but I am not sure how to get some data like genes index related to SMILES.
- Want to discuss a lot about that. 

## Next Step

- Meeting with Augustin to talk about the flow of this project and some finding.
- Deciding if retraining model or not.
